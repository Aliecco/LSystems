# L-systems

## Overview

## Program: Algorithmic Beauty of Plants

This program is inspired by the book “The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants” by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer. It utilizes L-systems (Lindenmayer systems) to simulate the growth patterns of plants and other natural phenomena. L-systems are a mathematical formalism that can be used to describe the recursive nature of plant structures.

## Features:

1.	L-System Implementation: The core of the program is the implementation of L-systems. It allows users to define production rules, axiom (starting string), and iterations to generate complex patterns from simple rules.
2.  Graphical Representation: The program provides a visual representation of the L-system output. Users can observe the growth and structure of plants as defined by the rules.
3.	Customizable Parameters: Users can customize the parameters such as angle of rotation, line length, and the rules to create a wide variety of patterns and structures.
4.  GitHub Repository: The code is open-source and available on GitHub, encouraging collaboration and further development by the community.

## Applications:

- Educational Tool: A valuable resource for students and researchers in computer science, botany, and mathematics to understand the principles of L-systems and their applications in modeling natural phenomena.
- Artistic Creations: Artists and designers can use the program to create intricate and visually appealing patterns and structures.
- Scientific Research: The program can be used in scientific research to simulate and study the growth patterns of various plant species.

## Future Work:
1. Make User-Friendly Interface: The program features an intuitive interface where users can easily input their desired parameters and instantly see the results.
2. Potential enhancements include adding more complex graphical features, expanding the library of predefined L-systems, and integrating more advanced algorithms to simulate a broader range of natural phenomena.
